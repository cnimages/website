      <description>KubeSphere project network isolation lets project administrators enforce which network traffic is allowed using rules.
Prerequisites  You have already enabled Network Policy. Please refer to network-policy if it is not ready yet. Use an account of the admin role at the project level. For example, use the account project-admin created in Create Workspace, Project, Account and Role.  Note
For the implementation of the Network Policy, you can refer to kubesphere-network-policy Enable/Disable Project Network Isolation By default project network isolation is disabled, you can turn on network isolation via Project Settings/Network Isolation Note</description>

      <description>A project in KubeSphere is a Kubernetes namespace, which is used to organize resources into non-overlapping groups. It represents a logical partitioning capability as it divides cluster resources between multiple tenants.
A multi-cluster project runs across clusters, empowering users to achieve high availability and isolate occurring issues to a certain cluster while not affecting your business. For more information, see Multi-cluster Management.
This chapter demonstrates the basic operations of project administration, such as creation and deletion.</description>
